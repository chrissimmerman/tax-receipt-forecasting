# Tax Receipts Forecasting Dashboard

## **Overview**
The **Tax Receipts Forecasting Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to model and forecast tax revenue under various economic scenarios. Built with **Streamlit**, this dashboard uses **SARIMAX models** with exogenous variables to generate insights into the impact of economic factors like **Corporate Profits (CP)** and **Job Openings (JTSJOL)** on tax receipts.

### Key Features:
- üìä **Dynamic Scenario Modeling**: Simulate scenarios such as recessions, booms, policy interventions, and pandemics.
- üîÆ **Extrapolative Forecasting**: Predict tax receipts and key economic indicators over a user-defined time horizon.
- üìà **Customizable Visualizations**: Explore trends in Corporate Profits, Job Openings, and Tax Receipts using intuitive plots.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Machine Learning Models**: Leverage **SARIMAX** and **Unobserved Components Models (UCM)** for accurate predictions.
